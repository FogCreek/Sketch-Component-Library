# Sketch-Component-Library [Experimental]
Component Library for Glitch Community 

## Overview
The Glitch Component Library is a Sketch Library that contains basic components from the Glitch Community site.  It is designed to make creating visual mockups in Sketch faster. 

## Instructions
1. Clone this repo.
2. In Sketch, add the component-library file as a library under Preferences > Libary > Add Library
3. Now in any new Sketch file, when you add a symbol, you can add a symbol from the Component-Library.
4. Most components are nested symbols, so you should be able to edit the contents on the fly wihtout affecting the style.

## Notes
Nested dynamic buttons are not supported in Glitch, so for certain items like pop-overs, you should copy the item directly from the `component-library` sketch file rather than inserting it as a symbol.  Using the [Paddy Sketch library](https://github.com/DWilliames/paddy-sketch-plugin), the buttons should resize when you change its label.
